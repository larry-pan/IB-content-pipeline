All mathematical expressions MUST be written in valid LaTeX format. You will generate a JSON list called 'parts', where each element is a sub-question. Each sub-question must have:\n\n  - 'content': a clear and challenging question string with equations and numbers in latex.\n  - 'marks': how many marks the question is worth, with more marks for harder questions.\n  - 'markscheme': an IB-style markscheme string which focuses as much as possible on concise numerical steps with almost no word descriptions, showing the major computational steps in latex to solve the problem while including exactly how mark are awarded. \n  - 'subtopics' for a list of IB subtopics that the question covers, which may overlap into other topics.\n\nMake sure all questions and answers are rigorous and well-aligned with the IB Math syllabus.\n\nTopics and subtopics are and strictly limited to:\n\n- Number and Algebra: standard form, arithmetic sequences and series, geometric sequences and series, financial applications, logarithms, simple proof, laws of exponents and logs, sum of infinite geometric sequence, binomial theorem, permutations and combinations, partial fractions, complex numbers, polar and Euler form, complex roots of polynomials, proof by induction, systems of linear equations\n- Functions: equations of straight lines, function notation domain and range, graphing, key features of graphs, composite functions, quadratic functions, solutions of quadratic equations, reciprocal and rational functions, exponential and logarithmic functions, solving equations, transformation of functions, factor and remainder theorems, odd and even functions, solutions of inequalities, graphing modulus equations\n- Geometry and Trigonometry: 3D space and volume, 2D and 3D trigonometry, applications of trigonometry, circles and radians, unit circle definitions, Pythagorean identity, circular functions, solving trigonometric equations, reciprocal trigonometric ratios, compound angle identities, vector definitions, scalar product, vector equations, classification of lines, vector product, intersections of lines and planes\n- Statistics and Probability: sampling techniques, histograms and data visualization, measures of central tendency, correlation and regression, probability concepts, combined and conditional probability, discrete random variables, binomial distribution, normal distribution, regression analysis, independence testing, Bayes theorem, properties of random variables\n- Calculus: differential calculus introduction, increasing and decreasing functions, differentiating polynomials, tangents and normals, integration introduction, chain product and quotient rules, second derivative, optimization, kinematics, indefinite integration, definite integrals, limits and L'Hopital's rule, implicit functions, integration techniques, areas and volumes, differential equations, Maclaurin series\n"},{"role":"User","content":"Numbers and Algebra"},{"role":"Chatbot","content":"content: Express $\\frac{2.4 \\times 10^{-3} \\times 8.1 \\times 10^{6}}{3.6 \\times 10^{2}}$ in standard form.\nmarks: 3\nmarkscheme: $\\frac{2.4 \\times 8.1}{3.6} \\times \\frac{10^{-3} \\times 10^{6}}{10^{2}}$ (M1)\n$5.4 \\times 10^{1}$ (A1)\n$5.4 \\times 10^{1}$ or $54$ (A1) [3 marks]\nsubtopics: ['Standard form']\ntopic: Number and algebra"},{"role":"User","content":"Numbers and Algebra"},{"role":"Chatbot","content":"content: The sum of the first $n$ terms of an arithmetic sequence is $S_n = 3n^2 + 2n$.
